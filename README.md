ATM Interface in Java
This repository contains a simple implementation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface in Java. The code provides functionalities such as depositing money, withdrawing money, transferring money, checking transaction history, and exiting the system.

Features
Deposit: Allows users to deposit money into the ATM.
Withdraw: Enables users to withdraw money from the ATM, provided they have sufficient balance.
Transfer Money: Simulates transferring money from the ATM to another account.
Transaction History: Displays a list of all transactions performed.
Exit: Allows users to exit the ATM interface.
Code Structure
The code is structured into two main classes:

Transaction: Represents individual transactions with attributes such as type (e.g., Deposit, Withdrawal) and amount.

ATM: Manages the ATM functionalities and transaction history. Key methods include:

deposit(double amount): Adds money to the ATM balance and records the transaction.
withdraw(double amount): Deducts money from the ATM balance if sufficient funds are available and records the transaction.
transfer(double amount): Simulates transferring money to another account.
displayTransactionHistory(): Prints out all transactions recorded.
main(String[] args): Simulates the ATM interface with a menu-driven approach using Scanner for user input.
